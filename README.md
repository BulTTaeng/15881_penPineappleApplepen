## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/15881_penPineappleApplepen/blob/main/15881_pro.PNG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming (Greedy)

## What was the key point and the hard part?

This is greedy algorithm because we only accept continuous pPAp.

Just checking them from the start and if pPAp exist, add 1 to the final answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
